Users must kill the process (Ctrl+C) which is not graceful.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Core\n1. Add CancellationToken to AgentContext (using tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken)\n2. Propagate token through agent hierarchy (orchestrator → planner → workers)\n3. Check token in agent execution loops before each LLM call\n4. Cancelled status already exists in AgentStatus enum - use it properly\n\n### CLI\n- Add command: `demiarch agents stop` - stops all running agents\n- Add command: `demiarch agents stop \u003cagent-id\u003e` - stops specific agent\n- Show 'Stopping agents...' feedback\n\n### TUI (demiarch-tui)\n- Add keybind: 's' or 'Escape' to stop all agents\n- Add keybind: 'x' to stop selected agent\n- Show 'stopping...' state in agent tree during graceful shutdown\n- Update status bar to show stop option\n\n### Web UI (future)\n- Add 'Stop' button next to running agents\n- Add 'Stop All' button in toolbar\n- Real-time status updates via WebSocket\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CancellationToken added to SharedState or AgentContext\n- [ ] All agent types check cancellation before LLM calls\n- [ ] CLI 'agents stop' command triggers cancellation\n- [ ] TUI keybinds stop running agents\n- [ ] Agents transition to Cancelled status properly\n- [ ] Visual feedback in all UIs during cancellation","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jlcochran2013@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T14:40:28.578021063-06:00","created_by":"Jason Cochran","updated_at":"2026-01-21T14:40:41.634846754-06:00"}
